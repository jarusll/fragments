# My mobile phones until now  #

I have timestamped them with my school grades because I don't remember exact years.

My first ever personal phone. It was Java based. I rocked this for about 2 years. I played so many games on this thing. Some of the ones I can recall is Spiderman, Street fighter ripoffs, Tomb raider. And ofc bounce.

I used to spend hours downloading apps & games. And it actually took time because I had to find the ones for my phones resolution. Yes, Apps came with their own resolution. And not only that, app compatibility wasn't guaranteed. The only way to know it was to run it.
Some of the best apps I can recall for this phone are Facebook, Ebuddy, Opera Mini, UCBrowser. Gameloft games were big on Java.

## Samsung Corby Pro B5310 ##
  * 7th grade - 9th grade

The first touch & multitasking phone for me. I discovered that feature after a year. I din't even know Java phones had multitasking. And ofcourse the slider keyboard.

Having this thing in my pocket I no longer felt like a boy, I was a grown up man.

## Nokia N91 ##
  * 9th grade - 10th grade

My first Symbian phone. This was during when N95 was the coolest phone around. But I couldn't get one so I got an N91. 

This thing was a chonky boi. I learnt alot with this phone. I tried jailbreaking & emulation. I used to emulate sega genesis & doom on this. And if you rotated & mapped the music buttons It actually felt like a handheld, just like N95.
  
This would be end of T9 layout for me.
  
## Samsung Galaxy Y GT-S5360 ##
  * 10th Grade

My first Android phone. I explored rooting & custom roms with it. 

Installing Tablet roms on the small screen was fun.

  * 10th grade - 12th grade

My first tablet, I bought this to read. I only used this to read, didn't really tinker around with it.
I read alot.

This was during the time When I got my first PC & I lost interest with mobile tinkering.

I still tinkered with it with Xposed modules. This was the peak of android mods. I maximised my battery life with Greenify, Amplify. Customized my ui with XBlast, hide my details with XPrivacy. 

## Vivo Y20 ##
  * 2nd year Uni - Current

I do not mess around with this phone. Its my daily driver & I want stability. I do not care about launchers or battery life or performance because it has it all. I want things to just work and it does. 

I plan to use it as long as I can. When I get another phone(which is not anytime soon), this will become my emulation phone. I'll buy a telescopic controller & play games on it.
