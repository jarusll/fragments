* Substring without repeating characters(WRC)
  
- Is =a= a substring of =abb=?
  - Yes, =abb= contains =a=

- Is =a= a substring WRC of =abb=?
  - Yes, =a= occurs only once in the substring =a=

- Is =ab= a substring WRC of =abb=?
  - Yes

- Is =abb= substring WRC of =abb=?
  - No, =b= occurs twice

- Can we say for substring WRC =X= and an adjacent character =x= to be a substring WRC in =Y=, =x= should not occur in =X= ?
  where
| variable | value   |
|----------+---------|
| =X=      | =abc=   |
| =Y=      | =abcde= |
| =x=      | =d=     |
